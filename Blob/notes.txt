Blob:

1. What's Blob?
Blob is Binary Large Object, it's normally a type of storage, we call it "blob storage".

2. Why we introduce Blob? What's the problem blob storage solved than other storage?
Normally we have traditional storage like file storage or block storage:
- File storage is stored with hierachy, think how you store your file in your computer. Use case: document storage.
- block storage: The data are divided into blocks and each block has its own identifier. Use case: database(SQL and NoSQL).
For some large size data like media data or big image data, we can use "Object Storage" to store those data, and blob is one of the Object Storage.
